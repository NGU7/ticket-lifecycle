This is a ticket from an end user about the online banking system failing. As it is an issue with a wide impact it was put in the high-priority queue of tickets that needed to be resolved. Once received, we sorted it and sent it to our online banking department for further investigation.

<p>
Once the ticket is assigned to the department, someone in the department acquires the ticket. After someone resolves the ticket, they site the problem and how they plan to fix it allowing others to understand what was done to resolve it. I played all these roles to better understand the flow of the ticket process.

</p>
<p>
When the tickets are completed they go to the "closed" section where admins can review them if needed.
